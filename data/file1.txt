Roger Federer is a Swiss former professional tennis player. He was ranked world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 310 weeks (the second-most of all time), including a record 237 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times.

Federer won 103 ATP Tour singles titles—the second most in the Open Era—including 20 major men’s singles titles. These include a record eight Wimbledon titles and a joint Open Era record five US Open titles. He also won six year-end championships.

For nearly two decades, Federer was a central figure in men’s tennis, forming the legendary “Big Three” alongside Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998 and former ball boy, Federer won his first major singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at the age of 21.

From 2004 to 2009, he dominated men’s tennis, reaching 20 of 24 major singles finals. He won three of the four majors and the Tour Finals in 2004, 2006, and 2007. Federer also captured five consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open during this period.

In 2009, he completed the career Grand Slam by winning the French Open after three runner-up finishes to Nadal. That same year, he broke Pete Sampras’ record by winning his 15th major title at Wimbledon.

Federer, alongside Stan Wawrinka, led Switzerland to its first Davis Cup title in 2014. They had previously won Olympic doubles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Federer also earned a silver medal in singles at the 2012 London Olympics, finishing runner-up to Andy Murray.

After knee surgery in 2016, Federer returned in 2017 to win three more majors, including the Australian Open (defeating Nadal) and a record eighth Wimbledon title. In 2018, he won the Australian Open again, becoming the first man to win 20 major singles titles and, shortly after, the oldest ATP world No. 1 at age 36.

Federer retired from professional tennis in September 2022 following the Laver Cup.

Known for his elegant, all-court playing style, Federer was admired worldwide. Though he lacked self-control as a junior, he matured into a gracious competitor, winning the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award a record 13 times and the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award five times.

Off the court, Federer co-founded the Laver Cup and is an active philanthropist through the Roger Federer Foundation, which supports children in southern Africa. He also organized the Match for Africa exhibition series to raise funds.

By the end of his career, Federer was consistently among the top-ten highest-paid athletes in the world and led all athletes in endorsement income in 2020, earning over $100 million.
