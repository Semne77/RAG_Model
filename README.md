# ðŸŽ¾ Tennis Q&A â€” RAG Pipeline


![Tennis Banner](image/Big3.jpg)

This project is a small **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application** built to answer questions about Tennis "Gig 3" (Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal) using a local knowledge base of `.txt` documents.

It demonstrates how to combine **document search** and **AI text generation** using Python, FAISS, and HuggingFace models.

## ðŸš€ What this program does

âœ… Splits long tennis articles into small, meaningful text chunks  
âœ… Converts these chunks into vector embeddings  
âœ… Stores them in a FAISS vector database for fast similarity search  
âœ… When the user asks a question:
- It finds the most relevant chunks
- It passes the context to a pre-trained language model (`Flan-T5`)  
- âœ… Returns a final, AI-generated answer
